## About Me

I am a Computational Social Scientist and Population Geographer, currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Durham University's Evidence Centre for Education, transitioning to the University of Sheffield's Methods Institute in August 2025. My research focuses on using AI/ML and advanced quantitative methods to understand and address spatial inequalities.

### Research Interests
- Spatial Inequalities & Accessibility
- Computational Social Science
- Health Geography
- Intersectionality (MAIHDA methodology)
- Educational Segregation
- Population Geography
